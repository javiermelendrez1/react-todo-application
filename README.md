## General Information
- I created this project using React. For the styling I used a combination of  MaterialUI and styled-components.
- I created this project to practice creating CRUD(CREATE-READ-UPDATE-DELETE) applications.
- Challenges I faced.
  - Initially I had trouble marking individual tasks as completed and deleting individual tasks.
  - I learned that assigning and using unique a ID can help specify which tasks you would like to interact with.
